to trigger reflection ask questions starting with what and how.


Motivation that comes from Git 

excited to be the first and best from newtork engineers to support DevOps team

	- multiline changes 
	- sublime looks so clean
	- like to type commands

how did viewing a diff between two versions of a file helo you see bug that was introduced?

	it made it easier (faster) to identify
